You must use Conventional Commits for commit messages.
Commit messages should follow the structure below:

makefile
Copiar
Editar
feat: (component name) - (brief description of the functionality)
fix: (component name) - (brief description of the functionality)
docs: (component name) - (brief description of the functionality)
style: (component name) - (brief description of the functionality)
refactor: (component name) - (brief description of the functionality)
test: (component name) - (brief description of the functionality)
chore: (component name) - (brief description of the functionality)
For example:

pgsql
Copiar
Editar
feat: button - add primary button style  
fix: input - fix input border color  
docs: button - update button documentation  
style: button - format button code  
refactor: button - refactor button component  
test: button - add unit tests for button component  
chore: button - update dependencies for button component  
Commit messages must be clear and concise, and describe the actual change made to the code.
Avoid vague or generic messages like “change” or “update.” Instead, use specific language that clearly describes the modification.

Commit messages must be written in English, and the first character should be lowercase.
Make sure the message is descriptive enough so that other developers can understand the change without needing to read the code.
